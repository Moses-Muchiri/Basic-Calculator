# Basic Calculator Program

## Description
This is a simple **Python calculator** that allows basic arithmetic operations (**addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division**). I've set the program to run in a continuous loop and allow exits at any point by typing `exit`. I have submitted this as my assignment for the Python module; for the PLP programme.

## Features
- Accepts **two numbers** from command-line input.
- Supports **four operations**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
- Prevents division by zero.
- Handles invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values).
- Runs continuously until the user types `exit`.

## How to Use
- To run the script using Python, enter the following command on the command-line :
```bash
   python app.py
```
- Enter the first number (or type exit to quit).
- Enter the second number (or type exit to quit).
- Enter the operation (+, -, *, /) or type exit to quit.
- The result will be displayed in the format {(number) (operation) (number) = (result)}.
- Repeat steps 2-5 or type exit to quit.
